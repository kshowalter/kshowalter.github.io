# Kennedy Space Center

My work as a mechanical engineer.

## Space Shuttle program

I primarily worked for the Space Shuttle program as an employee of United Space Alliance ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Space_Alliance)). My group provided engineering design for flight hardware support and lifting structures. We did not work on the space ship, but anything that touched it was our responsibility. 

Some samples of my projects:

  * Orbiter access stand railing upgrade

  * Crawler railing upgrade
  * SRB access stand RFP design

As a new engineer I was assigned a lot of railings.

## Constellation

I also worked on the (then) new Constellation project. Starting with tipping analysis of the rocket stacks when assembled in the VAB.

I also working on a large access platform that was to be used in the construction of the orbiter capsule. This took a lot of time and a lot of iterations to get a design that the client (Boing) was happy with.

## The Tourist

One advantage to working at the space center is that I get to go and see a lot of interesting places. Below are a few pictures from when I visited the crew compartment of one of the orbiters.
