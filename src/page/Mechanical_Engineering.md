# Mechanical Engineering

## Education

I studied architecture and engineering, among other things, at Florida Community College at Jacksonville (now known as Florida State College at Jacksonville). I ended up taking an AA degree to transfer to a university, since FCCJ did not offer bachelor's degrees at the time.

I received a B.S. degree in mechanical engineering from Florida International University. 

## Experience

### Construction

At my community collage I had an internship with Rollings construction. They were a small construction company that did a variety of commercial and residential jobs. My main responsibility was assisting with budget estimates that were used when bidding on projects.

### Electronics

After university I took a job at the Florida Solar Energy Center ([FSEC](#/experience/FSEC)). My group primarily dealt with photovoltac module testing, so I assisted with those activities. I also worked on some solo projects, such as revitalizing and control mapping a UPS style fuel cell. As a mechanical engineer, I learned a lot about electronics on that project. Even years later, I still think that thing was weirdly wired. I left FSEC when I got an offer to work at the space center I could not refuse.

### Mechanical and Structural

At the [Kennedy Space Center](#/experience/KSC) I worked for a company called United Space Alliance. Finally I get to use my mechanical engineering degree.
