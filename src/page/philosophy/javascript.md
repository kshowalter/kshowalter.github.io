# Keith Showalter's philosophy on JavaScript development.

I moved from PHP just before an explosion of JavaScript frameworks and modules.
Sure you could save a lot of time reusing someone else's hard work, but how much time will you spend choosing and learning the framework? Then in six months no one is using that framework anymore, and you have to start over. 

As someone that was new to the JavaScript ecosystem, I decided it made more sense to do it all myself, as a learning exercise. I developed and refined my own modules, and ways to build a webpage. I though: once I discovered what I really needed, and all the problems that need to be solved, I would be better equipped to select an external module to replace what I had done. What I discovered is that often I did not need to replace my simple solution. Except for dates. I don't want to deal with timezones. Momentjs all the way.

Of course this philosophy does not work as well in team environments. I would recomend this for solo/educational coding. At least until your modules are production ready.
