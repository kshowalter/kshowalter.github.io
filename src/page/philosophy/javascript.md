# Keith Showalter's philosophy on JavaScript development.

I moved from PHP just before an explosion of JavaScript frameworks and modules.
Sure you could save a lot of time reusing someone else's hard work, but how much time will you spend picking and learning the framework, the reevaluating it every six months. 
As someone that was new to the JavaScript ecosystem, I decided it made more sense to do it all myself, as a learning exercise. Once I discovered what I really needed, and all the problems that need to be solved, I would be better equipped to select an external module to replace mine. What I discovered is that often I did not need to replace my simple solution.
