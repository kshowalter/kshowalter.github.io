## About me

[![Keith Showalter|height:250,class:image_float_right](/assets/beach.jpeg)](/assets/beach.jpeg)

I am an engineer and a web developer. 

My university education is in mechanical engineering. 
I worked at the [Kennedy Space Center](#/experience/KSC) in a mechanical/structural group working on launch structures for the space program. 

I work at the [Florida Solar Energy Center](#/experience/FSEC) as a research engineer. A majority of my time here has been supporting the photovoltaic module testing, but in the last 4-5 years I have been developing [web based engineering software](#/projects/SPD).

More details are available at the links above, in my [resume](#/Resume), and throughout this site.

## Personal

I am a parent of young children, therefor I do not have much time for hobbies. I tend to align my personal interests with work and family responsibilities. 

I have always had an interest in photography, but I did not purchase my first interchangeable lens camera until after my first child was born. Most of my pictures are of family. I occasionally take the time to attempt artistic photography, and less occasionally post them online. I post some on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/mechkit/) and [500px](https://500px.com/mechkit). I also have a Google Photos [album](https://photos.app.goo.gl/Bb6fNvfAVeGsyo6L2).

I used to play video games. I got bored with most of them once I figured out how they worked and did most of what I could do. I was in to Minecraft for many years because I love to create. Drawing on my history with 3D CADD software, I have spent some time with Blender. It is a great program, I have even used it for video editing. However, I feel limited by the lack of parametric modeling and algorithmically created models. So my current focus is using my javascript skills to create procedurally generated worlds.
